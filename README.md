## Lab 2 - A Table For One


**Purpose:** This purpose of this lab is to expand on basic _HTML_, and to practice using tables and stylehsheets.

**Instructions:** Create an web page which will outline a fictional student class schedule. The columns should be the days of the week, and the rows should be the hours of the day. Tags you should utilize include &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, and &lt;td&gt;. You must also create an embedded stylesheet inside a &lt;style&gt; element. Use whatever selectors you need to create the style that you desire. You should definitely use classes, but any other selectors that we have looked at are allowed as well. Here is an example schedule that you can use as inspiration:

* ANI 100 - T,Th - 10am-11am
* BIO 121 - M,T,Th - 1pm-2pm
* BIO 121L Lab - W - 2pm-4pm
* ITECH 190 - T,Th - 9am-10am
* ENGL 101 - M,W,F - 11am-12pm

An example of what the final result might look like:
